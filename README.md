📊 Budget Tracker Visualization

This project is a Budget Tracker created using Excel to better understand how income and expenses flow together. The goal is to track financial details like salary, taxes, insurance, and other key categories. Using Funnel, Waterfall, and Donut charts, I explored different ways to break down and visualize the data for better insights.

📈 Project Overview

The Budget Tracker helps to:

Show a clear picture of income and expenses.

Use different charts to understand how money flows and where it goes.

Identify areas where savings can improve and track financial changes over time.

📊 My Learning with Charts

🔽 Funnel Chart

I used the Funnel Chart to display how expenses reduce total income step by step.

It shows the breakdown of costs (like rent, insurance, etc.) and makes it easier to see where most of the money is spent.

I found it useful because it visually explains how the total income reduces as we move through different spending stages.

💡 Other Use Case: Funnel charts are also used in business to track processes like sales funnels—showing how many leads become actual customers.

📊 Waterfall Chart

The Waterfall Chart is perfect for tracking how individual values (like income and expenses) add up to a final total.

In my project, I used it to show how different income sources and expenses come together to calculate net profit.

This chart helped me clearly see the impact of each income and expense on my total savings.

💡 Other Use Case: Waterfall charts are often used for cash flow analysis to show how revenue and costs impact the final balance over time.

🍩 Donut Chart

I used a Donut Chart to visualize how much of my total income goes to expenses and how much is left for savings.

It made it easier to compare the share of each category.

🚫 Why not a Pie Chart?

Clarity: Donut charts provide a clearer comparison, especially when there are many categories.

Modern Look: Donut charts give a cleaner, more modern presentation.

Context: The center of a donut chart can highlight totals, which adds extra information.

💡 Other Use Case: Donut charts are often used to show market share breakdowns or to visualize percentages in survey responses.

📊 What I Learned

Different charts tell different stories: Funnel charts are great for tracking steps, Waterfall charts show cumulative changes, and Donut charts highlight proportions.

Visualizing financial data makes it easier to understand patterns and identify areas for improvement.

Choosing the right chart matters—a Donut chart worked better than a Pie chart for this project because it added clarity and focus.
